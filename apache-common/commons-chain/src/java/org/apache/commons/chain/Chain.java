/**
 * <p>A {@link Chain} represents a configured list of
 * {@link Command}s that will be executed in order to perform processing
 * on a specified {@link Context}.  Each included {@link Command} will be
 * executed in turn, until either one of them returns <code>true</code>,
 * one of the executed {@link Command}s throws an exception,
 * or the end of the chain has been reached.  The {@link Chain} itself will
 * return the return value of the last {@link Command} that was executed
 * (if no exception was thrown), or rethrow the thrown exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that {@link Chain} extends {@link Command}, so that the two can
 * be used interchangeably when a {@link Command} is expected.  This makes it
 * easy to assemble workflows in a hierarchical manner by combining subchains
 * into an overall processing chain.</p>
 *
 * <p>To protect applications from evolution of this interface, specialized
 * implementations of {@link Chain} should generally be created by extending
 * the provided base class {@link org.apache.commons.chain.impl.ChainBase})
 * rather than directly implementing this interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link Chain} implementations should be designed in a thread-safe
 * manner, suitable for execution on multiple threads simultaneously.  In
 * general, this implies that the state information identifying which
 * {@link Command} is currently being executed should be maintained in a
 * local variable inside the <code>execute()</code> method, rather than
 * in an instance variable.  The {@link Command}s in a {@link Chain} may be
 * configured (via calls to <code>addCommand()</code>) at any time before
 * the <code>execute()</code> method of the {@link Chain} is first called.
 * After that, the configuration of the {@link Chain} is frozen.</p>
