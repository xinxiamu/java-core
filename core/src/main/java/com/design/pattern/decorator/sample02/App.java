/**
 * The Decorator pattern is a more flexible alternative to subclassing. The Decorator class
 * implements the same interface as the target and uses composition to "decorate" calls to the
 * target. Using the Decorator pattern it is possible to change the behavior of the class during
 * runtime.
 *
 * <p>In this example we show how the simple {@link SimpleTroll} first attacks and then flees the
 * battle. Then we decorate the {@link SimpleTroll} with a {@link ClubbedTroll} and perform the
 * attack again. You can see how the behavior changes after the decoration.
